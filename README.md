## Python Project for Data Engineering

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing the Python project completed as part of the IBM Data Engineering Professional Course. Throughout this mini-course, I assumed the role of a Data Engineer, tackling various tasks essential to the field.

**Project Overview:**

In this project, I delved into the realm of Data Engineering by addressing a specific scenario and dataset. My tasks encompassed extracting data from diverse file formats, gathering data through APIs and web scraping techniques, and ultimately transforming this collected data into a format ready for loading.

**Key Highlights:**

- Extraction of data from multiple file formats.
- Collection of data via APIs and web scraping methods.
- Transformation of raw data into a refined, ready-to-load format.

**Submission:**

I've documented my journey and solutions in a Python notebook, alongside accompanying screenshots to provide visual context. Your feedback and evaluation are highly appreciated as I strive to enhance my skills and understanding in the field of Data Engineering.

Thank you for visiting my repository. Feel free to explore the code and offer any insights or suggestions!
